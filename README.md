# Final Project - A Helping Hand community

## Collaboration Between Anna and Susanne

This project is a collaborative effort between Anna and Susanne, marking the culmination of our web development bootcamp journey.

## Project Overview

A Helping Hand is all about the community coming together and helping each other out. The goal for this school project to serve as a catalyst, inspiring the community to actively engage in meaningful efforts to assist others.

After posting your requests, you can sit back and wait for someone to volunteer to help out, or you can browse through all the help that is needed. When volunteering, you're email will be sent to the person that asked for help so they can choose to contact you.

The status of both your requests and the deeds you volunteered for, can be found on your profile page. If you no longer need any assistance, or if the deed had been done, you can delete your request from the hub.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** We've designed an intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform to ensure a seamless experience for both those seeking help and volunteers.

- **Connection Between Neighbors:** Our hub is focused on connecting people within the same community, fostering local bonds and a spirit of togetherness.

- **Request Posting:** Users can post tasks or requests for help, providing details about the assistance they require.

- **Volunteer Sign-Up:** Individuals interested in helping can sign up as volunteers, expressing their willingness to contribute to their community.
